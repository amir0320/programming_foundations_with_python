# Programming Foundations with Python
This repository includes all projects I did for Udacity course: [Programming Foundations with Python](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd004/).

## Mini Projects

- **rename_files**: remove all numbers contained in the file-name of all files under a specific folder
- **take_breaks**: active alarm to remind me take breaks every two hour and automatically open my favorite music
- **mindstorms**: some crazy turtles are drawing shapes
- **turtle_flower**: a little turtle draws a flower
- **send_text**: use twilio to send text messages from your computer to your friends
- **check_profanity**: check if there is any curse words in a given file
- **pirate_speech**: translate a file into a pirate speech

## Final Project
- **movies**: a website with my favorite movies' storyline, poster and trailer

## Required Libraries and Dependencies
Python v2.* should be sufficient.


## How to Run the Project
- First, clone or download the repository, then open the Terminal, change your current directory to the downloaded folder.
- For the mini projects just type: `python [project_file_name]`
- For the Final project, change directory to the **movies** folder
- Then type `python entertainment_center.py`
